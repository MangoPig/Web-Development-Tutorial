Currently the most used IDE worldwide and the tool we will using most of the time in the course, Visual Studio Code is a free IDE that is developed by Microsoft. It has many amazing features that we will be utilizing fully in this course, such as:

- Auto Complete (Emmet)
- Extensive Extension Library
- Integrated Terminal
- Git Source Control
- Color Brackets
- Auto Formatting
- Docker
- Any Many More

##### Installing and Using VS Code

Go to [VS Code Downlooad Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) to download the latest version of VS Code that's compatible to your system.

> ❗ Remember to check "Add to Path" and the "Open With Code" options during the installation wizard to fully utilize the VS Code CLI.

To open any directory in VS Code. Run `code .` or `code path/to/directory/` in the CLI.

> You can also open the directory using file explorer ➡️ right click ➡️ Open With Code. But I won't recommend this method because as of 2022/06, it has a bug that won't detect the WSL system if done this way.

``` JavaScript
console.log('Hello World')
```

``` Shell
npm run start
```
