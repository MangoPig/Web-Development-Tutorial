## [How Does a Computer Work?](https://youtu.be/vqs_0W-MSB0)

The first step in becoming an efficient and proper programmer is to understand the tools you're using. You don't need to know how to build it or design it, but understanding the hardware that you are writing your code for will help make sense a lot of difficult concepts and help write more efficient code.

### CPU (Central Processing Unit) ðŸ§ 

A CPU is a silicon computer chip containing millions of transistorized circuits. Electrical pulses passes through the chip which switch the transistor on and off (1 and 0) which is treated as the basis of instructions to the computer.

A CPU is the brain in a computer. Its main purpose is to be the taskmaster of the computer, managing every input and output. By design, CPU performs actions sequentially. Cores of a CPU also is designed to be smarter than a GPU. All these make the CPU great for running and managing complicated and different tasks.

Most CPUs in today's markets have multiple cores. Meaning that although each core only does one computation at a time, you can take advantage of the other cores to do other computations meanwhile.

### [GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)](https://youtu.be/-P28LKWTzrI) ðŸ“º

Since CPU is designed to run sequentially. It is not great at running a massive amount of simple and repetitive task. Hence why the GPU is designed. Unlike CPU, one core of GPU do computation in parallel, which make it excellent for running such tasks like video rendering and machine learning.

### Computer Memory

Once the processing is finished. The information (1s and 0s) needs to be stored somewhere for future uses. That's where memory comes into play.

#### Hard Drives

##### SSD (Solid State Drive)

##### HHD (Hard Disk Drive)

#### RAM

## Levels of Programming Language

Lower Level = How close you are to what the computer is actually doing

### Low Level Programming Language

#### Machine Language (Machine Code)

#### Assembly Language

### Mid Level Programming Languages

Most system programming languages. Makes OS and compilers

#### C

#### C++

#### Rust

#### Go

### High Level Programming Language

#### C\#

#### Java

#### Python

## Frontend? Backend?

## Web Browser and NodeJS

Rendering Engine

V8 = Javascript Engine that Blink uses

Blink = Reads DOM
